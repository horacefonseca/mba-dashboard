## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError" during deployment

**Solution**: Check `requirements.txt` has all packages
```
streamlit==1.29.0
pandas==2.1.0
plotly==5.17.0
networkx==3.2
```

### Issue: "FileNotFoundError: data/pbi_association_rules.csv"

**Solution**:
1. Check GitHub repository has `data/` folder
2. Verify all 4 CSV files are in `data/` folder
3. Push again if missing:
   ```bash
   git add data/
   git commit -m "Add data files"
   git push
   ```
4. Redeploy app on Streamlit Cloud

### Issue: App shows but charts don't load

**Solution**: Clear browser cache or try incognito mode

### Issue: Git push asks for username/password repeatedly

**Solution**: Use Personal Access Token as password (see Step 2.6)

### Issue: "Repository not found" on GitHub

**Solution**: Make sure repository is Public, not Private

### Issue: Streamlit Cloud says "App is in a failed state"

**Solutions**:
1. Check deployment logs for specific error
2. Verify Python version compatibility (3.8-3.10)
3. Check all file paths are correct (case-sensitive)
4. Try restarting the app via Streamlit dashboard
