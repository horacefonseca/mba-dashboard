## 📊 Data Files Description

All data files were generated through a rigorous 5-step cleaning and analysis process:

### Cleaned Datasets

#### 1. `pbi_association_rules.csv`
**8 association rules** discovered using the Apriori algorithm with minimum support of 3% and minimum lift of 1.0.

**Columns:**
- `antecedents` - Product(s) in the "IF" part of the rule
- `consequents` - Product(s) in the "THEN" part of the rule
- `support` - Frequency of itemset occurrence (0-1)
- `confidence` - Probability of consequent given antecedent (0-1)
- `lift` - Association strength (>1 indicates positive correlation)
- `leverage` - Difference from random co-occurrence
- `conviction` - Dependency strength measure

**Business Use:** Identify high-value product pairings for bundling and cross-selling strategies.

#### 2. `pbi_item_frequencies.csv`
Item popularity statistics across all transactions.

**Columns:**
- `item` - Product name
- `frequency` - Total occurrence count
- `support_pct` - Percentage of transactions containing the item

**Business Use:** Understand product popularity and identify potential hub products for strategic placement.

#### 3. `pbi_transaction_statistics.csv`
Summary metrics of the cleaned dataset.

**Metrics:**
- Total Transactions: 5,315
- Average Basket Size: 2.1 items
- Unique Items: 92 products
- Data Retention: 72.85% of original data

**Business Use:** Baseline metrics for measuring campaign success and ROI.

#### 4. `pbi_item_pairs_network.csv`
Network relationships between item pairs for graph visualization.

**Columns:**
- `item1` - First item in the pair
- `item2` - Second item in the pair
- `support` - Co-occurrence frequency
- `lift` - Association strength

**Business Use:** Visual identification of product communities and relationship networks.

## 💡 Understanding Association Metrics

### Support
**Definition:** How frequently items appear together in transactions

**Formula:** `Support(A,B) = Transactions with (A and B) / Total Transactions`

**Business Interpretation:** Market size of the opportunity
- **Example:** 5% support = items appear together in 5% of all transactions

### Confidence
**Definition:** Probability of purchasing item B given purchase of item A

**Formula:** `Confidence(A→B) = Support(A,B) / Support(A)`

**Business Interpretation:** Recommendation success rate
- **Example:** 75% confidence = 75% of customers who buy A also buy B

### Lift
**Definition:** Strength of association compared to random chance

**Formula:** `Lift(A→B) = Confidence(A→B) / Support(B)`

**Business Interpretation:**
- **Lift > 1:** Positive association (items complement each other)
- **Lift = 1:** No correlation (independent purchases)
- **Lift < 1:** Negative association (potential substitutes)
- **Example:** Lift of 2.5 = items are 2.5× more likely to be purchased together than by chance

### Leverage
**Definition:** Difference between observed and expected co-occurrence

**Formula:** `Leverage(A,B) = Support(A,B) - Support(A) × Support(B)`

**Business Interpretation:** Absolute impact magnitude of the association

### Conviction
**Definition:** Dependency strength measure

**Formula:** `Conviction(A→B) = [1 - Support(B)] / [1 - Confidence(A→B)]`

**Business Interpretation:** Degree of implication; higher values indicate stronger dependencies

- Display "Customers Also Bought" suggestions

**3. Store Layout Optimization**
- Position associated products adjacently
- Create dedicated bundle display areas
- Separate items with negative associations

**4. Marketing Campaigns**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Local Deployment Issues

```bash
# Verify Python version (3.8 or higher required)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Clear Streamlit cache if experiencing issues
streamlit cache clear

# Run with verbose logging
streamlit run app.py --logger.level=debug
```

### Data Loading Errors
- Ensure the `data/` folder exists in the same directory as `app.py`
- Verify all 4 CSV files are present with correct names
- Check file encoding (should be UTF-8 or latin-1)

### Dashboard Performance
- For large datasets: Increase minimum support threshold to reduce rule count
- Network graph limited to top 15 rules for optimal performance
- All data loading functions use caching for faster response times

## 📊 Data Processing Methodology

### 5-Step Cleaning Process

1. **Remove Missing Values** - Eliminated null entries in critical fields
2. **Standardize Item Names** - Trimmed whitespace and ensured consistent naming
3. **Remove Invalid Items** - Filtered placeholder and invalid product entries
4. **Eliminate Duplicates** - Removed duplicate Transaction-Item pairs
5. **Filter Transactions** - Kept only transactions with 2+ items (required for MBA)

**Result:** 72.85% data retention, 5,315 clean transactions from original 9,684
